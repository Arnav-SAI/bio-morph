# BioMorph 🌌✋

**BioMorph** is an interactive, browser-based digital art experiment that fuses computer vision with 3D generative particles. Experience a living particle system that reacts in real-time to your hand gestures.

## ✨ Features

- **Gesture Control**: Uses your webcam to track hand movements. Open and close your hand to expand or contract the particle field.
- **Dynamic Templates**: Switch instantly between 3D formations:
  - 🔮 **Sphere**: The default energetic state.
  - 💙 **Heart**: A parametric 3D heart.
  - 🌸 **Flower**: Organic petal mathematical formations.
  - 🪐 **Saturn**: Ringed planetary system.
  - 🧘 **Buddha**: Meditative point-cloud silhouette.
  - 🎆 **Fireworks**: Explosive radial bursts.
- **Real-time Customization**: Change particle colors on the fly.
- **Zero Install**: Runs entirely in the browser with no build steps required.

## 🛠️ Technologies

*   **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: 3D rendering engine.
*   **[MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)**: Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
*   **Vanilla JS**: No frameworks, no build tools, just pure code.

## 🎮 Controls

*   **Left/Right Hand**: Move to influence the scene.
*   **Pinch/Fist**: "Tension" increases, causing particles to expand or react aggressively.
*   **Relaxed Hand**: Particles return to their base stable state.
*   **Mouse/Touch**: Rotate and zoom the camera view.
